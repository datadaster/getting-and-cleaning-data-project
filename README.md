<b>Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project</b>

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

- Download the dataset if it does not exist.
- Load the activity and feature info.
- Loads the training and test datasets.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
